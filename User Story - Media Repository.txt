User Story: Media Repository

As application developer I need a digital asset management system to structure my stored images so that my images are available for simple retrieval.

Acceptance Criteria:

Functional - The structure of the repository should include application -> category -> necessary subfolders if needed

Non-functional - The service needs to be structured in a way that is standardized such that images can be retrieved upon a request with minimal potential for accidental errors (similar files for different applications). It should successfully store and retrieve a file with greater than 99% accuracy.
