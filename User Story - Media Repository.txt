User Story: Media Repository

As application developer I need a digital asset management system to structure my stored images so that my images are available for simple retrieval.

Acceptance Criteria:

Functional Requirements

Repository Structure

  Given I am viewing the directory structure,
  When I list the available directories,
  Then the repository should be structured in the following hierarchy:
      application → category → (optional subfolders)

Non-Functional Requirements

Reliability

  The system must successfully store and retrieve images with ≥99% accuracy, including correct associations between applications and their assets.

Standardization

  Repository structure, naming, and REST endpoint format must be consistent across all applications.
