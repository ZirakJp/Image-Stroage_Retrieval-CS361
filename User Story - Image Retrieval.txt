User Story: Image Retrieval

  As an application developer,
  I need to retrieve stored images from the digital asset management system
  so that my applications can dynamically load the correct media files for display or processing.

Acceptance Criteria:

Functional Requirements

Direct Retrieval by Path

  Given a client provides a valid path in the format; /{application}/{category}/{filename}.{ext}
  Then the service should return:
      HTTP 200 OK
      The binary image file or a JSON response containing the file’s URL, metadata, and access permissions.

Non-Functional Requirements

Reliability

  Retrieval operations must succeed ≥99% of the time under standard network conditions.

Performance

  Average response time for single-image retrieval must be under 300ms.
