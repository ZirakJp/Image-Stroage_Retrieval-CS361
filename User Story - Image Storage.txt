User Story: Image Storage

  As an application developer,
  I want to be able to store images in a structured and standardized way,
  so that my images are available for simple and reliable retrieval by various applications.

Acceptance Criteria:

Functional Requirements

Upload Endpoint

Given a valid image file and metadata payload are provided by a client via REST API (e.g., POST /api/v1/assets/{application}/{category}),
  When the request is sent with appropriate headers and body content,
  Then the system should:
    Validate file type and size (e.g., .png, .jpg, .webp, .svg)
    Store the file in the correct directory structure: 
      /application/category/filename.ext
    Return a JSON response with status and metadata

Non-Functional Requirements

Performance

  Image uploads should complete in under 500ms for average file sizes (<1 MB) under normal network conditions.

Scalability

  The system should support tens of thousands of stored images without directory degradation or slow lookups.
